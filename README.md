This is what I created in order to practice how to make live2d from scratch, and there will be more updates on model to improve it's quality.

In the hope of bringing Cyannyan more attention, I am releasing this exported model publically.

As License permits, it's free to use both Commercially / Privately. I personally wish this become something included in Live2D viewers as example file - I'll try to improve this further to reach that quality.
